Popular options include the **Cotton Candy Frost**, a delightful mix of blue raspberry and white chocolate, and the **Double Torture Freeze**, which combines extra espresso with vanilla and chocolate.

For something lighter, their iced teas and lemonades are refreshing choices. The **Passion Fruit Iced Tea** and **Strawberry Lemonade** are particularly popular among customers seeking a fruity, thirst-quenching option.
